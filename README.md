# Python Automation Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of real automation projects I built using Python.  
Each project demonstrates a practical workflow used in freelance jobs such as:

- Web scraping
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Automating Google Sheets updates
- Structuring data pipelines
- Building reliable scripts with error handling and logging

The goal of this portfolio is to show my ability to automate repetitive tasks for businesses and deliver clean, reliable datasets.
